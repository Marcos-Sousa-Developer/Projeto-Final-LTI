WHAT IS FAULT TOLERANCE?

Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption when one or 
more of its components fail.
The objective of creating a fault-tolerant system is to prevent disruptions arising from a single point of failure, ensuring the high 
availability and business continuity.

SPECIFICATIONS

Redundancy: The app may have redundancy built-in at various levels to ensure that if one component fails, 
there is another component available to take its place.
This include multiple web servers, database servers, and load balancers. 

Load Balancing: The app may be designed with a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple web servers.
This ensures that if one web server fails or becomes overloaded, the load balancer can automatically redirect traffic 
to other web servers.

Data Backup and Recovery: The app may have a robust backup and recovery strategy in place for its database. 
This could include regular backups, replication of data, or other techniques to ensure data can be restored 
quickly in case of a failure.

Error Handling: The app may have mechanisms in place to detect and handle errors that occur during operation. 
This could include error logs, automated alerts, or other techniques to ensure that errors are detected and 
addressed quickly.

Monitoring: The app may have robust monitoring capabilities, so that faults can be detected as soon as possible. 
This could include monitoring of software services, network connections, and other system parameters.

Testing: The app may be thoroughly tested to ensure that it can handle various types of faults and failures. 
This could include stress testing, fault injection testing, or other techniques to simulate different types of faults.

Security: This could include measures to prevent unauthorized access, 
encryption of sensitive data, and other security measures to protect the app and its users.

Documentation: Include documentation.
